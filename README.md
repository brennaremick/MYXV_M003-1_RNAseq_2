# MYXV_M003-1_RNAseq_2
Code in this repository was used to analyze RNA-seq data from control and gene-deficient (N4BP1, ZC3H12A, N4BP1/ZC3H12A KO) BLaER1 monocytes expressing myxoma virus M003.1; from the manuscript: "Attack of host anti-viral pathways by a myxoma virus virulence factor unleashes effector-triggered NF-ÎºB signaling"

File descriptions:

analysis_2.R - describes differential gene expression analysis by DESeq2

Fig4B_heatmap.R - code for generating Fig 4B (heatmap of top 30 genes by variance as well as TNF and IL6)

Fig4C_plot.R - code for generating Fig 4C (4-way plot comparing differential gene expression)
